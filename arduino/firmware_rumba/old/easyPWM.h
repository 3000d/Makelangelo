 *  Version 0.1
 *
 *  Software 50Hz PWM, fully compatible with Receiver.h.
 *  20 mS period, 1000 to 2000 Âµs pulsewidth.
 *  Uses PB0 to PB5 for a total of up to 6 outputs.
 *  Has a range of 2000 to 4000 (2000), where an increase of 1 equals half of a microsecond.
 *  If you want a 1000 to 2000 range instead, just left shift whatever value you have 1 step
 *
 *	CAN NOT RESET TIMER1 FOR ANY REASON
