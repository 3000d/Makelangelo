h1. DrawBot - A mural drawing robot for students
Drawbot is intended to teach students about programming, physics, trigonometry, and electronics in a fun, goal-oriented way.
Drawbot is scalable to suit your wall size.

*The hardware*
* An Arduino Mega 2560
* one USB cable to connect the Mega to your PC
* one Adafruit stepper motor shield
* two NEMA17 stepper motors
* one 12 volt, 2 amp power supply
* two sewing machine bobbins
* >=10m of sewing thread.  I used nylon and most anything will work.
* one 9g servo

*Setup*
Picture the L(left) stepper and the R(right) stepper are at the ends of a line LR.  LR runs horizontally across the top of the rectangular drawing area that measures W*H.  Halfway between L & R is point P.  Halfway between P and the bottom of the drawing area is point O, which should be in the middle of the board. The computer thinks O is at (0,0), L is at (-W/2,H/2).  It thinks P is at (0,H/2).
# Attach the shield to the Arduino. !https://github.com/i-make-robots/DrawBot/blob/master/wiring.jpg?raw=true(Drawbot Wiring Example)!
# Stepper L is connected to M1 (red & green) and M2 (blue & yellow) on the Adafruit shield.  Stepper R is attached to M3 & M4 in the same way.  If your wire colors differ, see the FAQ.
# Put the bobbins on the stepper shafts.  A small piece of tape around the stepper shafts will make a tight fit.
# Attach the string to the bobbins.
# Use loadSpool() in setup() to wind 5m of thread onto your bobbin.  You can alter this to load more or less depending on your needs.
# Attach the plotter to the other end of the strings.  A slip knot will be easy to remove and never let go at the wrong moment.
# Gently turn the bobbins until the plotter is halfway between the steppers and halfway between the top and bottom of the area you will draw in.  I recommend you only do this with the power off.
# Measure the distance (cm) from the center of stepper shaft 1 to stepper shaft 2.  This will be the X_SEPARATION value at the top of your code.
# Measure the distance (cm) from the plotter center up to the line between the shafts.  This will be your LIMYMIN.
# Measure the distance (cm) from the plotter center down to the bottom of the drawing area.  This will be your LIMYMAX.
# Plug in your Arduino.  Plug in your Adafruit 12v power supply.
# Use the Arduino programming environment to update your configuration.  Look for the following lines: X_SEPARATION, LIMYMIN, and LIMYMAX.
# Upload your changes to the Mega.  Open the Arduino Serial Interface.  You should see "== HELLO WORLD ==" followed by instructions.
# Follow the on-screen prompts.

h1. FAQ
h3. My code won't upload.
Assuming you don't have a programming error, check that Tools->Board = Arduino Mega 2560 or Mega ADK and that Tools->Serial Port is on the correct COM port.

h3. I open the serial interface but there's only garbled text.
Change the baud rate to 57600.

h3. My steppers make a grinding sound and/or don't move right.
a) There is one or more loose or incorrect connection(s) between the Adafruit shield and the steppers.  Screw terminals and Molex connectors are often the culprit.
b) Crimping wires together is not as good as soldering.

h3. I run "demo" and my picture is small on top, big on the bottom.
Your motors are turning the wrong way and your picture is upside down.

#define REEL_IN         FORWARD
#define REEL_OUT        BACKWARD

should be reversed

#define REEL_IN         BACKWARD
#define REEL_OUT        FORWARD

like so.

h3. I run "demo" and my pictures are tall & thin / short & fat
LIMYMIN is not quite right.  Remeasure distance PO.

h3. I run "demo" and my pictures are skewed to one side.
The pen must start at O.  Even a little to one side and the simulation will not match reality.

h3. I tried "line x5" and the plotter moved to the left.
Motor 1 is wired to M3M4 and motor 2 is wired to M1M2.  They're backwards.

#define M1_PIN          (2)
#define M2_PIN          (1)

should be reversed.  See the example in the previous question.

h3. Where can I find more info about DrawBot?
